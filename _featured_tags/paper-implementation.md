   Computer science is becoming heavily reliant on academia in pursuit of more effective, effecient algorithms, especially in the field of machine learning. The best way to understand them is not only through reading the papers repetitively but by finding practical ways to implement them in real life. In this study, concepts stated on research papers were implemented by using programming languages.
