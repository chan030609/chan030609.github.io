### _My life motto is..._

> “When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.”

Do without questioning the odds. This is one of the quotes from Elon Musk, the _[Technoking](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331315/elon-musk-tesla-technoking-title-ceo)_ of the future. It is very rare to find one with both futuristic vision and practical plan. I admire his efforts to achieve both.
